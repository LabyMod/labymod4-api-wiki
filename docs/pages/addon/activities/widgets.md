Widgets are a valuable and easy way to customize your Activities and are the backbone of every themeable Activity.

## Use Widgets in Activities

This part will show you how to use and integrate Widgets into your Activity. Looking back at our bare Activity example, we rendered the text `"I am a bare rendered example text"`, so we'll be using a ComponentWidget just this time with the text `"I am an example text rendered with a ComponentWidget"`. We're building onto the code from the previous example so if you haven't already gone through it, we recommend taking a look at it <a href="/pages/addon/activities/activity/">here</a>.

???+ warning "Important Note"

    Remember that we're explaining the Activity System in multiple steps. This part of the page will explain how to create Activities with Widgets but without LSS. This is for example purposes only; we highly recommend using Widgets and LSS in your Activities, as the system is not optimized for Widgets without LSS. It is possible but don't expect your code to work forever; there is a high chance that the methods you use will be deprecated at any time.

Looking back at the bare Activity example, we remove the `render` method overwrite, as we don't need that anymore because the ComponentWidget will render the text for us. Now we overwrite the `initialize` method. Keep in mind that the super call has to be at the head of the method body. The method will be called any time the window is resized, the Activity is manually reloaded, or when the Activity was opened.

Then we create a new ComponentWidget. In this case, we will create a non-translatable ComponentWidget by calling `ComponentWidget.text` and declare our text as the first parameter. Because we want our text to be colored, we'll set the color of our choice as the second parameter, in this case, Gold. The call should look like this in the end: `ComponentWidget.text("I am an example text rendered with a ComponentWidget", NamedTextColor.GOLD)`. Now we just declare it as a field and call `this.document().addChild(this.componentWidget)` as this will add the ComponentWidget to our Activity.

Theoretically, we could start the client, and our text would be rendered. But we haven't set the position yet. We'll only look at LSS in the next part, so we need to set the position with our Java code. To do this, we need to overwrite the protected void `postStyleSheetLoad` and again keep the super call as it notifies all child widgets that the style sheets have been loaded. We don't use those yet, but we leave the call in anyways. This method is called when all style sheets have been loaded and applied, just as the name suggests.

Now we get the bounds of our activity with `this.bounds()` and the bounds of our ComponentWidget via `this.componentWidget.bounds()` and set the position of said widget with `widgetBounds.setPosition(activityBounds.getCenterX(), activityBounds.getCenterY()`. As we want the ComponentWidget to be centered we need also to add `this.componentWidget.alignmentX().set(WidgetAlignment.CENTER)` and `this.componentWidget.alignmentY().set(WidgetAlignment.CENTER)` this centers the Widget horizontally and vertically. 

### Widget Activity Result

Like with the bare Activity, this is what the code we described above would look like:

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: ExampleBareActivity"
    ```java
    @AutoActivity
    public class ExampleWidgetActivity extends SimpleActivity {
    
      private ComponentWidget componentWidget;
    
      @Override
      public void initialize(Parent parent) {
        super.initialize(parent);
    
        this.componentWidget = ComponentWidget.text(
            "I am an example text rendered with a ComponentWidget",
            NamedTextColor.GOLD
        );
        this.document().addChild(this.componentWidget);
      }
    
      @Override
      protected void postStyleSheetLoad() {
        super.postStyleSheetLoad();
    
        Bounds activityBounds = this.bounds();
        Bounds widgetBounds = this.componentWidgetBounds.bounds();
        componentWidgetBounds.setPosition(
            activityBounds.getCenterX(),
            activityBounds.getCenterY()
        );
    
        this.componentWidget.alignmentX().set(WidgetAlignment.CENTER);
        this.componentWidget.alignmentY().set(WidgetAlignment.CENTER);
      }
    }
    ```

#### Scroll

The `ScrollWidget` is a Utility-Widget that allows scrolling Widgets vertically (preferably `VerticalListWidget` or `TilesGridWidgets`). 
It automatically adds a `ScrollbarWidget` as its second child.
The child has to have their height set to `fit-content`, and the `ScrollWidget`'s height has to be fixed for everything to work.
Can be created with either `new ScrollWidget(VerticalListWidget)` or `new ScrollWidget(Widget, ListSession<>)`. <br>
The Widget has the following LSS properties: 

 + `enable-scroll-content` - if content should be scrolled when dragging the mouse (default is `false`)
 + `scrollSpeed` - how fast the content should be scrolled (default is `-1`, set to `-1` to calculate the scroll speed automatically based on the number of children)
 + `child-align` - where the content should be aligned - either `top`, `center` or `bottom` (default is `top`)

##### Scrollbar

### Abstract Widgets

Abstract Widgets are not for direct use and are therefore intended exclusively for inheritance and extension.

#### Abstract Widget

The `AbstractWidget` is the main implementation of almost every Widget. 
The generic type declares the type of its children. <br>
The Widget and, therefore all inheriting Widgets have the following LSS properties (if no default value is specified, the default value is `null`, and the property has to be set to take effect) <br>
As there are so many, they are split into different sections:

##### Positioning (Bounds)

Every property (except the `padding` and `margin` allrounder) in this section can also have a percentage. The `width: 5%` will result in the width being 5% of the parent's width.

 + `left` - the relative left position to the parent
 + `top` - the relative top position to the parent
 + `right` - the relative right position to the parent
 + `bottom` - the relative bottom position to the parent
 + `width` - the width (can be a number but also `fit-content` or `height`)
 + `height` - the height (can be a number but also `fit-content` or `width`)
 + `max-width` - the maximum width (useful when the widget has no fixed width)
 + `max-height` - the maximum height (useful when the Widget has no fixed height)
 + `min-width` - the minimum width (useful when the Widget has no fixed width)
 + `min-height` - the minimum height (useful when the Widget has no fixed height)
 + `padding` - the padding (has to be this format: `TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT` or just one number to set the same padding in all directions)
 + `padding-top` - the padding at the top (default is `0.0`)
 + `padding-right` - the padding at the right (default is `0.0`)
 + `padding-bottom` - the padding at the bottom (default is `0.0`)
 + `padding-left` - the padding at the left (default is `0.0`)
 + `margin` - the margin (has to be this format: `TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT` or just one number to set the same margin in all directions)
 + `margin-top` - the margin at the top (default is `0.0`)
 + `margin-right` - the margin at the right (default is `0.0`)
 + `margin-bottom` - the margin at the bottom (default is `0.0`)
 + `margin-left` - the margin at the left (default is `0.0`)
 + `alignment-x` - the horizontal anchor point of the widget - either `left`, `center` or `right` (default is `left`)
 + `alignment-y` - the vertical anchor point of the widget - either `top`, `center` or `bottom` (default is `top`)
 + `use-floating-point-position` - if the position should use Float instead of Integer (default is `false` in Vanilla- and `true` in Fancy-Theme)
 + `fit-outer` - if fit-content should be applied to the outer instead of the inner bounds of the children (default is `false`)

 + `render-children` - if the children should be rendered (default is `true`)
 + `renderer` - which `ThemeRenderer` the Widget uses
 + `scale` - the scale in which the Widget is rendered (default is `1.0`)
 + `visible` - if the widget is visible or not (default is `true`)
  
##### Behavioral

 + `always-focused` - if the Widget should always have the attribute `FOCUSED` (default is `false`)
 + `background-always-dirt` - if the background should always stay dirt, even if ingame (default is `false`)
 + `background-dirt-shift` - the shift of the dirt background

 + `pressable` - if clicking the widget fires the `Pressable` callback (default is `true`)
 + `priority-layer` - depending on what is set the Widget will be rendered before everything else or after - either `very-back`, `back`, `normal`, `front`, `very-front` (default is `normal`)
 + `stencil` - if the widget content should not be able out of bounds (default is `false`)

#### List Widget

The `ListWidget` is the parent of every list like Widget. <br>
The Widget has no own LSS properties.

#### Simple Widget

The `SimpleWidget` inherits `AbstractWidget` and removes the generic. <br>
The Widget has no own LSS properties.

#### Wrapped Widget

The `WrappedWidget` is a "pseudo Widget" that wraps around its child and acts like it. <br>
The Widget has no LSS properties as it redirects everything to its child. **deprecated!**
