First you'll need a Java IDE, as of now we only support
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a>. Then download <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html" target="_blank">JDK (Java Development Kit) 21</a> if you haven't already.

Differences between the "Community" and "Ultimate" edition:

- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** is the free to use version for everyone.
- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate** is the version where you need a valid subscription based license.

You can apply for a free educational license at Jetbrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
Its also possible obtain an "Ultimate" edition license if you are part of the <a href="https://education.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Global Campus</a> where you can apply <a href="https://education.github.com/pack/join" target="_blank">here</a>.
