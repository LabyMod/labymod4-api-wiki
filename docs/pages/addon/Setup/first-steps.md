First you'll need a Java IDE, as of now we only support
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a>. Then download JDK (Java Development Kit) 17 if you haven't already and install it.


Now 
<a href="https://github.com/LabyMod/addon-template" target="_blank">download or clone our addon template</a> and open it in your preferred IDE.
