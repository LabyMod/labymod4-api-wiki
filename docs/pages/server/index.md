    You'll need Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher to be able to use the LabyMod 4 Server API (the Velocity platform-specific implementation requires JDK 17 or higher)

## Adding the LabyMod Repository

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)"

    ```kotlin
    repositories {
        maven {
            name = "labymod"
            url = uri("https://dist.labymod.net/api/v1/maven/release/")
        }
    }
    ```

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: Gradle (Groovy)"

    ```groovy
    repositories {
        maven {
            name = "labymod"
            url = "https://dist.labymod.net/api/v1/maven/release/"
        }
    }
    ```

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: Maven"

    ```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>labymod</id>
            <url>https://dist.labymod.net/api/v1/maven/release/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    ```

## Adding the LabyMod 4 Server API as a Dependency

Depending on the actual artifact you want to use, you have to add the following dependency to your project. Listed below are the available artifacts and their use cases:

- `api` - The protocol itself without any LabyMod-specific code. Useful if you want to just use the protocol.
- `core` - The LabyMod implementation of the protocol, containing all packets and models to interact with the LabyMod client. Use this if you want to communicate with the LabyMod 4 Server API platform-independently.
- `server-bukkit` - The platform-specific implementation of the LabyMod Protocol for Servers running on Bukkit (Spigot, Paper, etc.).
- `server-bungeecord` - The platform-specific implementation of the LabyMod Protocol for Servers running on BungeeCord.
- `server-velocity` - The platform-specific implementation of the LabyMod Protocol for Servers running on Velocity.
- `server-common` - Contains shared classes and utilities used across different server implementations to ensure consistent behavior and reduce code duplication. Use this if you want to create your own platform implementation.

    For the examples below, replace `ARTIFACT` and `VERSION` with the artifact and version you want to use. The latest version can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/LabyMod/labymod4-server-api/releases" target="_blank" style="display: inline-flex;-ms-transform: translateY(25%);transform: translateY(25%);">![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/LabyMod/labymod4-server-api?label=%20)</a>


=== ":octicons-file-code-16: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)"

    ```kotlin
    dependencies {
        compileOnly("net.labymod.serverapi:ARTIFACT:VERSION")
    }
    ```

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: Gradle (Groovy)"

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        compileOnly "net.labymod.serverapi:ARTIFACT:VERSION"
    }
    ```

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: Maven"

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>net.labymod.serverapi</groupId>

        <version>VERSION</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

## Setting up Your Plugin

Each officially supported server platform has two types of implementations. 

1. You load the official jar file into your server's plugins folder and add it as a plugin dependency to your plugin.
2. You shade the dependency into your plugin and initialize it manually, effectively eliminating the need to have the 
Server API run as a separate plugin.

### Bukkit Plugin

#### Running the Server API as a Plugin

1. Add the `server-bukkit` dependency to your project's dependencies as described above.
2. Download the latest version of the `server-bukkit` jar file from the <a href="https://github.com/LabyMod/labymod4-server-api/releases" target="_blank">GitHub Releases</a>.
3. Place the jar file in your server's `plugins` folder.
4. Add the following line to your plugin's `plugin.yml`:
    ```yaml
    depend: [LabyModServerAPI]
    ```
5. You're now ready to use the LabyMod 4 Server API in your Bukkit plugin.

#### Shading the Server API into Your Plugin

1. Add the `server-bukkit` dependency to your project's dependencies as described above.
2. Configure shadow in your project's `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` to shade the `server-bukkit` dependency into your plugin.
3. Initialize the LabyMod 4 Server API in your plugin's `onEnable` method:
    ```java
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        LabyModProtocolService.initialize(this);
    }
    ```
4. You're now ready to use the LabyMod 4 Server API in your Bukkit plugin.

### BungeeCord Plugin

#### Running the Server API as a Plugin

1. Add the `server-bungeecord` dependency to your project's dependencies as described above.
2. Download the latest version of the `server-bungeecord` jar file from the <a href="https://github.com/LabyMod/labymod4-server-api/releases" target="_blank">GitHub Releases</a>.
3. Place the jar file in your server's `plugins` folder.
4. Add the following line to your plugin's `plugin.yml` or `bungee.yml`:
    ```yaml
    depend: [LabyModServerAPI]
    ```
5. You're now ready to use the LabyMod 4 Server API in your BungeeCord plugin.

#### Shading the Server API into Your Plugin

1. Add the `server-bungeecord` dependency to your project's dependencies as described above.
2. Configure shadow in your project's `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` to shade the `server-bungeecord` dependency into your plugin.
3. Initialize the LabyMod 4 Server API in your plugin's `onEnable` method:
    ```java
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        LabyModProtocolService.initialize(this);
    }
    ```
4. You're now ready to use the LabyMod 4 Server API in your BungeeCord plugin.

### Velocity Plugin

#### Running the Server API as a Plugin

1. Add the `server-velocity` dependency to your project's dependencies as described above.
2. Download the latest version of the `server-velocity` jar file from the <a href="https://github.com/LabyMod/labymod4-server-api/releases" target="_blank">GitHub Releases</a>.
3. Place the jar file in your server's `plugins` folder.
4. Add the following code to the `Plugin` annotation above your plugin's main class:
    ```java
    dependencies = {
        @Dependency(id = "labymod-server-api")
    }
    ```
5. You're now ready to use the LabyMod 4 Server API in your BungeeCord plugin.

#### Shading the Server API into Your Plugin

1. Add the `server-velocity` dependency to your project's dependencies as described above.
2. Configure shadow in your project's `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` to shade the `server-velocity` dependency into your plugin.
3. Initialize the LabyMod 4 Server API in your plugin's `ProxyInitializeEvent` listener:
    ```java
    @Subscribe
    public void onProxyInitialization(ProxyInitializeEvent event) {
        LabyModProtocolService.initialize(this, this.server, this.logger);
    }
    ```
4. You're now ready to use the LabyMod 4 Server API in your Velocity plugin.
